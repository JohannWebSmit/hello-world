# hello-world
First Repository

I am a multimedia producer. Worked in TV production as a video editor and camera operator in field and studio, as well as audio post production, digital music composition, graphic design, and some web design with WordPress and some CSS/HTML.

But the time is past due to take the next step in my education (apart from the university degree I am still pursuing in IT-Web Development), which means... Git Hub and FreeCodeCamp.

I look forward to this journey.
